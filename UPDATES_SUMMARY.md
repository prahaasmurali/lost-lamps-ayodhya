# 🎯 Updates Made to "The Lost Lamps of Ayodhya"

## ✅ Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. 🔀 **Shuffled Logic Puzzle Options**
**Problem**: Clue 2 had predictable options (option 1 for Arjun, option 2 for Priya, etc.)

**Solution**: 
- **Shuffled colors**: `["Bronze", "Golden", "Silver", "Copper"]` (instead of alphabetical)
- **Shuffled offerings**: `["Incense", "Fruits", "Sweets", "Flowers"]` (randomized order)
- **Added proper logic clues** to make the puzzle solvable:
  1. "Arjun brought sweets and his diya wasn't bronze or copper"
  2. "The person with the silver diya brought flowers"
  3. "Priya's diya was silver, and she didn't bring incense"  
  4. "Vikram brought incense, and his diya wasn't golden or silver"

### 2. 👤 **Player Registration System**
**Added**: Name and email capture before starting the game

**Features**:
- **New Component**: `PlayerRegistration.tsx` 
- **Required Fields**: Name and email validation
- **Email Validation**: Must contain "@" symbol
- **Integrated into Landing Page**: Shows after clicking "Start the Hunt"

### 3. ⏱️ **Game Timing System**
**Added**: Completion time tracking and display

**Features**:
- **Start Time**: Recorded when game begins (localStorage)
- **End Time**: Calculated on victory page
- **Display Format**: "Xm Ys" (e.g., "5m 32s")
- **Player Info**: Shows name and email on victory

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **localStorage Keys Used**:

- `player_email` - Player's email address  
- `game_start_time` - Timestamp when game started
- `clue1_unlocked`, `clue2_unlocked`, etc. - Progress tracking

### **Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface LogicPuzzle {
  devotees: string[];
  colors: string[];        // Shuffled order
  offerings: string[];     // Shuffled order  
  clues: string[];         // Logic puzzle clues
  solution: {              // Correct answers
    [devotee: string]: {
      color: string;
      offering: string;
    };
  };
}
```

### **Timing Calculation**:
```javascript
const startTime = localStorage.getItem('game_start_time');
const endTime = Date.now();
const timeTaken = Math.floor((endTime - parseInt(startTime)) / 1000);
const minutes = Math.floor(timeTaken / 60);
const seconds = timeTaken % 60;
```
